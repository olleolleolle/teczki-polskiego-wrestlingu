<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<h4 id="the-2021-launch">The 2021 launch</h4>
<p>On June 28, 2021, Arkadiusz &quot;Pan&quot; Pawłowski, an experienced, yet polarizing figure on the Polish scene, announced the launch of his own wrestling promotion, promising &quot;a new quality of entertainment&quot;.
He posted a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=343114510600555&amp;ref=sharing">trailer</a> featuring himself and glimpses of various wrestlers.
Over the course of the summer, training events have been held and social media promotion continued.
Eventually, the first show <a href="/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja/">PTW#1: REVOLUCJA</a> was announced for October that year.
Gradually, the competitors have been revealed, featuring veterans of the Polish scene, debuting Polish wrestlers and foreign guests.</p>
<h4 id="2023-name-change">2023 name change</h4>
<p>Prior to the first event, on 21st of September 2021, Kinguin was announced as one of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PrimeTimeWrestlingPL/posts/pfbid02jM7go32wEREc9u2XofEbKhhHFhHohQ16Cb6dhCHXzQURZUZYGhzzeXCcDfu6x9k3l">sponsors</a>, later becoming the titular sponsor, and was added to the promotion's logo.
Kinguin is a marketplace selling digital items, primarily game keys and in-game currency.
The Kinguin mascot became a regular part of the shows, and even an angle with Taxi Złotówa at <a href="/e/ptw/2022-11-26-ptw-3-legends/">PTW#3 Legends</a>.</p>
<p>Though Kinguin's departure was never officially announced, the titular sponsor was gradually dropped from PTW's branding over the spring/summer of 2023.
The last Facebook post featuring Kinguin PTW name was from 26th March 2023, a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PrimeTimeWrestlingPL/posts/961567858196579:961567858196579">cover photo change</a> announcing <a href="/e/ptw/2023-04-23-ptw-underground-14/">Underground 14</a>.
Afterwards, none of the graphics for the show featured Kinguin in either logo or name.</p>
<h4 id="2023-crisis-and-departures">2023 crisis and departures</h4>
<p>In the aftermath of <a href="/e/ptw/2023-06-25-ptw-4-mystery/">PTW #4 Mystery</a>, build-up for the 5th major show started.
Initially planned for October 2023, the show was postponed indefinitely.
During that time, multiple talents started to voice their frustration on social media.
Eventually, <a href="/w/rafi/">Rafi Rarytas</a>, <a href="/w/gabriel-queen/">Gabriel Queen</a>, <a href="/w/justin-joy/">Justin Joy</a> and <a href="/w/samson/">Samson</a> were all removed from PTW's roster. See Justin's page for a series of screenshots from his social media where he addressed the situation.
During a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t8TTAVxQoE&amp;t=3s">shoot interview</a> for the &quot;Wrestling Polska&quot; YouTube channel, Samson stated that he &quot;never earned a single penny&quot; in PTW, that Underground shows were not paid appearances and only the &quot;big&quot; (numbered) events were, with the promotor urging talent to take the &quot;barter in training fee&quot; instead.</p>
<p>During a regular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmLHzSe92x0">live stream</a> for his YouTube supporters (video requires paid subscription), Pawłowski confirmed the accusations, stating that barter was an option, but always voluntary.
He also confirmed that PTW wrestlers are not officially contracted and their exclusivity is based on a gentlemen's agreement.
He emphasized that his goal is to make PTW a fully mainstream promotion, with wrestlers being able to earn their living just based on their PTW role, rather than an alternative, independent route with talent being able to freelance.
It was also announced that more roster cuts are to follow, especially after &quot;Season One&quot; is finished.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 2024, <a href="/w/vic-golden/">Vic Golden</a> was also quietly removed from the roster page.
<a href="/w/robert-star/">Robert Star's</a> departure went unnanounced by the promotion, with his profile removed at some point between January and March 2024. During an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRJrVjnAhyo">interview</a> for Istota Wrestlingu Youtube Channel, Robert confirmed his departure from PTW.</p>
<p>On February 12th, 2024, PTW commentary team member Piotr &quot;Showoff&quot; Małecki announced an indefinite leave from PTW, citing burnout as a reason. Gradually, he severed his ties with the organization, first changing his Twitter/X bio entry to &quot;ex-PTW commentator&quot;, and becoming increasingly critical towards them.</p>
<h4 id="expansion-into-austria">Expansion into Austria</h4>
<p>Throughout 2023, <a href="/w/krampus/">Krampus</a>, in addition to his in ring career in PTW, launched a wrestling promotion of his own, WWA (Wrestling World Austria).
The first set of tapings was announced for September 29th 2023, emanating from City Theater in Hallein, Austria. Among others, the show featured multiple talent from PTW.
On December 4th 2023, both PTW and WWA <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PrimeTimeWrestlingPL/posts/pfbid0Hfpa8ep1gi8X9NfmmkR3f5D8gVvZ4edWPTPVVvi3bZxuJRzFUywnD3n6AVzuvFDPl">announced</a> that WWA has now become a part of PTW.</p>
<p>The initial name for the this merged promotion was &quot;PTW: WWA&quot; (also stylized as &quot;PTW presents: WWA&quot;), but the organization soon adopted &quot;PTW German&quot; as their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ptwwrestlingdeutsch">social media name</a>. In addition to covering their own shows, this account reposted PTW's updates concerning events in Poland, but translated to German.</p>
<h4 id="2024-pawlowski-s-solo-run">2024: Pawłowski's solo run</h4>
<p>On Monday, March 11th 2024, Marcin &quot;Rzeźnik&quot; Rzeźniczek, co-owner of PTW, officially confirmed on his social media that he left PTW and Pawłowski remains the sole leader. Breaking kayfabe (a recent storyline from <a href="/e/ptw/2024-02-03-ptw-5-gold-rush/">PTW#5 Gold Rush</a> revealed him as the mastermind behind Bad Bones and Longman shenanigans), he wished his former partner, and everyone in PTW the best of luck conquering the Polish and world wrestling scenes, and fondly recalled his time in PTW.</p>
<h5 id="the-lottery">The Lottery</h5>
<p>At the Gold Rush event, Pawłowski revealed a new promotional scheme for PTW: a 2012 Nissan GTR car, the grand prize to be won in a lottery. To circumvent the legal age requirement, lottery tickets were not sold directly. Instead, fans were encouraged to purchase an ebook, which came with a free ticket. These ebooks were short PDF documents (e.g. &quot;<a href="/e/ptw/2021-10-09-ptw-1-revolucja/">PTW Revolucja</a>&quot; at 16 pages), including results from PTW's shows, photos and a short narrative. It was apparent that they were not supposed to provide any useful content, but rather serve as a legal means for distributing lottery tickets. The car was claimed to be worth 600 thousand PLN, or about 140 thousand EUR at the time.</p>
<p>In the following months, leading to <a href="/e/ptw/2024-04-13-ptw-underground-21/">Underground 21</a> and <a href="/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6/">Total Blast From The Past</a> he promoted the lottery heavily on social media, and in collaboration with various online personalities, most of who had nothing to do with wrestling.
Immediately after Underground 21, PTW's social media accounts continued to focus solely on the lottery, while promoting the next major show took a distant second place, restricting itself to revealing the card in a series of posts.
The organization cared so little for promoting its own show, that it did not even try managing WrestleFans' accidental reveal of the full match card, which was leaked before PTW revealed the final match themselves.
The leak was accidentally posted by Wrestlefans' newsman Piotr &quot;Sabinq&quot; Gilewski. <a href="/w/taras/">Taras</a> called him out on the mistake on Twitter/X, and in turn revealed that he also was on a lengthy break from PTW, although officially not released yet.</p>
<h5 id="the-stonoga-controversy">The Stonoga controversy</h5>
<p>On May 8th, in a move mocked by fans and PTW wrestlers alike, notorious Polish businessman and whistleblower Zbigniew Stonoga announced that he bought 1500 tickets for <a href="/e/ptw/2024-05-11-ptw-6/">PTW#6</a>, and wants to distribute them for free to his supporters (who sent him money and received a numbered membership card). The next day, Stonoga posted photos of himself and the car, as well as short clips of himself on the passenger seat. Later, he announced handing out 50 tickets, free and for anyone, in a McDonald's restaurant in Legionowo. This move prompted Taras to seemingly cut his ties with PTW, declaring he's finally &quot;quitting this circus&quot;.</p>
<p>Other PTW personalities, like <a href="/w/disco-pablo/">Disco Pablo</a>, the already-mentioned ex-commentator Piotr Małecki, and current commentator Arek Paterek also addressed the situation.
Their posts ranged from open critique to only vague references. After Pablo and Taras made their comments, fans speculated about Pablo leaving PTW as well, which Pablo strongly denied.
Some fans also alleged that Taras' current frustration was a result of losing the PTW Tag Team Championship, which he also denied.</p>
<p>The two wrestlers' criticism of PTW was also met with backlash. On PTW's public Facebook group, an account named Jakub Tyczyński (presumably a PTW personality, current or former) accused them of using their good relations with Pawłowski against other wrestlers in the past, and trying to play martyrs now.</p>
<p>This string of PR flops, and apparent disinterest from PTW prompted Wrestlefans to pull out of promoting PTW with immediate effect, only 3 days before the show. And in another unexpected turn of events, some of the fans who received tickets from Stonoga turned ot to be <a href="/o/ppw/">PpW</a> personnel. This got them both a free ticket for the show, and some social media exposure, through photos and live video which Stonoga, unfamiliar with the wrestling scene, shared.</p>
<p>During this time, PTW remained silent, attempted to control the situation by deleting comments pertaining to the Stonoga situation from the fan group, and continuing to promote... the lottery.</p>
